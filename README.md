## Welcome to IDDS

This repository aims at becoming a workbench for researches to play with a simple but realistic model of infectious-disease spreading.

### Introduction

The year 2020 became an incredibly complicated and unpredictable journey in which people of all nationalities have been affected by a horrendous disease spreading problem (referred to as **CoVid19**). This world-wide problem came to us almost inadvertently because of the similitude of the symptoms associated with a common flu. However, this *coronavirus* (**SARS-CoV-2**) turned out being a much uncontrollable and pernicious than already-known coronaviruses, e.g., MERS and SARS. Unfortunately, humanity had to learn such a dramatic reality via the hard way. To date (October 2020), more than one million (1.07M) people have died due to the seemingly relentless virus, and more than thirty-nine million (36.9M) people have been infected worldwide. These tremendous and growing figures have been the main driver for an unprecedented spike of research in a single topic. The entire scientific community is in a unified effort on trying to *forecast* the spreading of this deadly virus, with the aim of shedding light onto the social measures we humans need to take in order to control the spreading whilst searching for a treatment, or even better a *vaccine*.
