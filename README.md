## Welcome to IDDS

This repository aims at becoming a workbench for researches to play with a simple but realistic model of infectious-disease spreading.

### Introduction

The year 2020 became an incredibly complicated and unpredictable journey in which people of all nationalities have been affected by a horrendous disease spreading problem (referred to as **CoVid19**). This world-wide problem came to us almost inadvertently because of the similitude of the symptoms associated with a common flu. However, this *coronavirus* (**SARS-CoV-2**) turned out being a much uncontrollable and pernicious than already-known coronaviruses, e.g., MERS and SARS. Unfortunately, humanity had to learn such a dramatic reality via the hard way. To date (October 2020), more than one million (1.07M) people have died due to the seemingly relentless virus, and more than thirty-nine million (36.9M) people have been infected worldwide. These tremendous and growing figures have been the main driver for an unprecedented spike of research in a single topic. The entire scientific community is in a unified effort on trying to *forecast* the spreading of this deadly virus, with the aim of shedding light onto the social measures we humans need to take in order to control the spreading whilst searching for a treatment, or (even better) a *vaccine*.

In this unified effort against the virus, the researching community is relying upon computational modelling for than ever before. The current scenario requires the possibility of testing *in-silico* the potential effects of different social behaviours and restrictions which cannot be carried out in live, for obvious reasons. Many models have come to light over the past few months, most of them based on deterministic equations which aim to describe the susceptible-infectious-recoverd (SIR) *flow*, which should be an average representation of what is happening out there. Such models focus then on the fitting of several free parameters of the SIR equations to try and understand the number of infections and the death toll. However, the simplicity of SIR models cannot incorporate in a natural way the complexity of a society as greatly evolved as ours. For this reason, we believe the most natural way of studying this problem should be by focusing on the individual, then suggesting an agent-based model. The SIR equations can then be seen as the simplified fluid equations compared to Molecular Dynamics. Obviously, there are model equations which are much more computationally efficient than integrating all the constituent particles' positions and velocities in time, but one cannot expect these simple equations to predict complex behaviours which are out of the underlying assumptions, e.g. this is the case of phase transitions and the Navier-Stokes equations.
